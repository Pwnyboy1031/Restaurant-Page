# Restaurant-Page
The Odin Project: Restaurant Page cont.

Prompt: " Let’s use what we’ve learned and take a chance to continue practicing DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering a simple restaurant homepage! By the end, we are going to be using JavaScript alone to generate the entire contents of the website! "

For this project I used a local food vendor as a model for my restaurant page mockup.
